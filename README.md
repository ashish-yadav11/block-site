# Block Site

**Block Site** is a simple Chrome extension that improves your productivity by
blocking access to distracting websites as you specify.

# Usage

To configure, click on the **B** icon in the toolbar and select **Options**
from the menu. Enter sites in the textbox, leaving a new line for each site
like this:

```
facebook.com
instagram.com
youtube.com
!music.youtube.com
twitter.com
reddit.com
!reddit.com/r/MachineLearning
```

Sites starting with `!` will be exceptions to the rule.
